            <b>Narendra Modi</b> is the 14th Prime Minister of the Republic of India. He started his life as a small kid who used to sell tea with his father in Vadnagar, Mehsana, Gujarat. Since his early childhood, he had a keen interest in helping people. Due to this reason, he joined the Bharatiya Janta Party in the year 1987. Soon after, with the hard work, he was elected for the general secretary of the Gujarat branch of BJP. With this clean heart and strong words soon after, he became the chief minister of Gujarat in the year 2001. He remained undefeated as the face of Gujarat for three consecutive terms and then was elected in the 2014 elections. Under the leadership of this great politician, each village in Gujarat has electricity. It is his dream to provide the same for the whole nation. He has been a great follower of the teachings of Swami Vivekananda·∏ç
