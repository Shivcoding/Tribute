        <p><b>Major Dhyan Chand</b> (29 August 1905 â€“ 3 December 1979) was an Indian field hockey player, regarded by many as the greatest field hockey player in history.[4][5][6] He was known for his extraordinary ball control and goal-scoring feats, in addition to earning three Olympic gold medals, in 1928, 1932 and 1936, during an era where India dominated field hockey. His influence extended beyond these victories, as India won the field hockey event in seven out of eight Olympics from 1928 to 1964.

            Known as The Wizard[8][9] or The Magician[10][11] of hockey for his superb ball control, Chand played internationally from 1926 to 1949, where he scored 570 goals in 185 matches according to his autobiography, Goal,[12][13] and over 1000 goals in his entire domestic and international career.[14] BBC called him the "hockey's equivalent of Muhammad Ali".[14] The Government of India awarded Chand India's third highest civilian honour, the Padma Bhushan in 1956.[15] His birthday, 29 August, is celebrated as National Sports Day in India every year. India's highest sporting honour, Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award is named after him</p>
